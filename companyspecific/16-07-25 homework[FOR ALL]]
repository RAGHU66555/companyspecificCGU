James has a sequence of N numbers. There is also an integer X which is a random number from other sources. He is allowed to perform a specific operation on this sequence X number of times. Below is the operation:

Pick exactly one element from the sequence and multiply it with -1.
Your task is to find out the number of different sequences which can be formed by performing the above operation. If the answer is large, print the result modulo 109 +7.

Let us try to understand it with an example,

N = 3
X = 2
S = [1, 2, 3]

There are 2 ways in which this operation can be performed.

Way 1: Either -1 should be multiplied to the same element 2 times, OR
Way 2: -1. Should be multiplied by two different elements once each.
Way 1:
If we multiply -1, to each element 2 times. It will become +1 (-1 *-1).
We will get the same sequence for each element:

Multiply -1, 2 times to S[1] : [1, 2, 3].
Multiply -1, 2 times to S[2] : [1, 2, 3].
Multiply -1, 2 times to S[3] : [1, 2, 3].
So, the unique sequence is just 1 which is [1, 2, 3].

Way 2:
If we multiply -1, by two different elements just 1 time each. We get:

Multiply -1 to S[1] & S[2] : [-1, -2, 3].
Multiply -1 to S[2] & S[3] : [1, -2, -3].
Multiply -1 to S[1] & S[3] : [-1, 2, -3].
Hence, we get a total of 3 different sequences from Way 2.
Total 1 + 3 = 4 different sequences.

Hence the answer is 4.000

Example 1:

Input:
3 1 -> Input integer, N, X
{1, 2, 1} -> Input integer, S
Output:
3 -> Output
Explanation:
In the given scenario, we have X =1. Hence, we can have this multiplication of -1 only once.
So, if we multiply -1, by different elements just 1 time. We get:
Multiply -1 to S[1] & S[2] : [-1, -2, 1].
Multiply -1 to S[2] & S[3] : [1, -2, -1].
Multiply -1 to S[1] & S[3] : [-1, 2, -1].
Hence, we get a total of 3 different sequences.
So, the answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input:
3 2 -> Input integer, N, X
{1, 2, 3} -> Input integer, S
Output:
4 -> Output
Explanation:
There are 2 ways in which this operation can be performed
Way 1: Either â€“ 1 should be multiplied to the same element 2 times, OR
Way 2: -1 should be multiplied by different elements once.
As shown in the above Demo example, there will be a total of 4 different sequences which can be achieved from this.
Hence the answer is 4.
